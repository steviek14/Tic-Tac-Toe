/*Explanation Breakdown:
1. Initalization: 
    - The HTML elements are selected and stored in variables using querySelectorAll and querySelector
    -The `winConditions` array defines all possible winning combinations of box indices
    -`placeholders` is an array to track the current state of each box
    -`currentPlayer` keeps track of whose turn it is 
    - `running` is a boolean variable to check if the game is in progress

2. startGame Function:
    -Adds event listeners to the boxes and restart button 
    -sets the inital status text and starts the game by setting `running` to `true` 

3.boxClicked Function:
    -retrieves the index of the clicked box 
    -checks if the box is already filled or if the game is not running
    -updates the box content and checks for a winner

4. updateBoxForTurn Function:
    -Updates the `placeholders` array and the box's text content based on the current player's turn

5. changePlayer Function:
    -switches the player and updates the status text 

6. checkWinner Function:
    -checks each win conidtion to see if any are met
    -updates the status text and game state accordingly

7. restartGame Function:
    -resets the game to its inital state
